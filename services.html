                        <p>A:Oil breaks down into sludge after it's been used in a hot environment such as your engine. This breakdown also causes it to lose its lubricating qualities otherwise knows as viscosity. Viscosity is the thickness of the oil which creates a slight buffer between metal parts in the engine. Scientists have found that this breakdown will not effect the engine's components as long as it is replaced at approximately 3000 mile intervals.</p>

                    <p>A:The same ASE certified technicians that we use to diagnose high tech computer problems are also the technicians that change your oil. When we perform our Roadworthy Vehicle Analysis with every oil change, you can rest assured that we are driving it with experienced ears and eyes...looking, listening and "feeling" if there are any potential problem areas that may need attention, reducing the chances of costly breakdowns.</p>

                    <p>A:Gasoline leaves a varnish-like residue on the intake manifold and fuel injectors. It also leaves carbon on the valves and pistons as it gets burned. All these deposits need to be removed in order for the engine to "breathe" properly. If these deposits are left in the engine for too long, they may even cause engine damage or failure. That is the long term benefit. The immediate benefit is the one you can "feel" when you drive a car with renewed power and fuel economy.</p>

                    <p>The one component on your car that causes the most breakdowns is your radiator. Now let us clarify that a bit. The problems are not necessarily the radiator itself, but the lack of it's cooling capabilities caused by infrequent antifreeze changes. Antifreeze has the tendency to lose its ability to remain a liquid in cold environments when its not changed regularly. At the same time it can't cool efficiently when it breaks down into more water than glycol. Chemists say that 30,000 mile intervals between changes is sufficient. Some GM vehicles have a synthetic base antifreeze that may be OK for longer periods. Check your owners manual or ask our service manager to check if your vehicle is equipped with this type of fluid. The best idea is to have it tested with a test strip. </p>

Like we have been teaching you about the other fluids in your car, this one can cause a lot of potential problems such as expensive rack and pinion replacements and/or pump replacements.

                        <p>A:Most mobile A/C manufacturers recommend service once per year, but we conservatively suggest every 2 years or 30,000 miles. This should be sufficient to prevent more costly repairs to your A/C system. Don't wait for the air conditioner to stop working. Service it while it's still functioning.

                        <p>Description: Brake fluid is a specially formulated liquid used in the brake hydraulic system. Brake fluid must meet one of three U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) specifications. DOT3 and DOT4 are glycol-based fluids, which absorb water. DOT5 is a silicone-based fluid and does not absorb water. The main difference is that DOT3 and DOT 4 absorb water , while DOT5 doesn't. Most cars use DOT3 fluid from the factory. Our owner's manual may specify periodic flushing and filling of the brake hydraulic system, which should not be overlooked. This is a service best left to professional technicians, as many cars with ABS have specialized brake-bleeding procedures.</p>

                        <h1>DIFFERENTIAL SERVICE</h1>
                        <p>Maintenance Tips/Suggestions: Have the axle lube level checked with every oil change. On most front-wheel-drive vehicles, the differential is part of the manual or automatic transaxle, and therefore does not require a separate differential lube check.</p>
                        <p> If you have a rear-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive vehicle, check the owner's manual to find out the recommended interval for differential lube changes. Positive-lock differentials may require a different lube or a lube additive.
                        <p> Many manufacturers claim their differentials to be "lubed for life", unless it has been submerged in water. If you have a pickup or SUV, this may happen quite often, especially if you pull a boat. If this is the case, have the axle lube changed at least once a year.</p>
                        <p>In cold climates, you may want to consider changing the standard axle lube to a synthetic type. Synthetic lubes flow easier in cold weather, improving lubrication. With a 4x4, this is doubly the case because of the two axles. Always use a lubricant that meets or exceeds the manufacturer's lube specifications. </p>
                        <p>When cared for properly, differentials provide many thousands of miles of trouble-free operation. When a differential problem does occur, symptoms may include: a high-pitch sound when accelerating or decelerating, clunking when accelerating or when shifting between reverse and drive, or a howling sound. Differential problems should be checked out as soon as possible by a qualified service professional.</p>
