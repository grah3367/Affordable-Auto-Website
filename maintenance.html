                <h2>The Secret to keeping a car for 200,000 miles?</h2>
                <p>Scheduled maintenance. Vehicle maintenance is like health insurance. It's always hard to spend money on something that won't give immediate results, but you know that it's something that may save you thousands of dollars in the future.</p>
<div class="box">
<p>All of these maintenance points are conveniently checked for 
 free when you have our free
 "Roadworthy Inspection" vehicle inspection!</p>

 

    
<ul style="font-size:16px;" id="manlist">
<li><span>Air Filter:</span> You should check the air filter every other month. It should be replaced when it's dirty or when you have your vehicle tuned-up. </li>

<li><span>Antifreeze:</span> You should check your antifreeze weekly. Some cars have transparent reservoirs with level markings. Fill to level marking with 50/50 solution of antifreeze and water. Caution: Do not remove the pressure cap when the engine is hot. </li>

<li><span>Battery:</span>  Use extreme caution when handling a battery as it can produce explosive gases. Do not smoke, create a spark or light a match near a battery. Always wear protective glasses and gloves while working with the battery. Have your battery checked with every oil change. Cables should be attached securely and be corrosion free. If your battery has filler holes, add only clear drinking water. 

<li><span>Belts:</span> Inspect belts and hoses once a month. Worn, glazed or frayed belts should be replace right away. Tighten them when more than 1/2" of slack can be depressed between the pulleys. Vehicles with spring loaded belt tensioners require no adjustment. Replace rotten or brittle hoses and tighten clamps. If a hose looks bad, or feels too soft or too hard, you should have it replaced. </li>

<li><span>Brake Fluid and brakes:</span> To check the brake fluid monthly, wipe dirt from the brake master cylinder reservoir lid. Pry off the retainer clip and remove the lid or unscrew plastic lid (this would depend on which type your vehicle has). If you need fluid, add the approved type and check for possible leaks throughout the system. Fill to mark on reservoir. Caution: Do Not Overfill. You should have your brakes checked at least once every six months. </li>

<li><span>Oil:</span> Check oil every other fill up. Pull out the dipstick, wipe it clean with a rag or paper towel then insert it fully and remove it once again. If it is low, add oil. To maintain peak performance, change oil every 3,000 miles or every 3 months, whichever comes first. Replace oil filter with every oil change. </li>

<li><span>Engine and transmission:</span>  Your engine and transmission should be serviced every 30,000 miles or in accordance with factory suggested maintenance in your owners manual. We have an Alldata information system for all makes and models to help you with the service intervals your car manufacturer suggests. </li>

<li><span>Exhaust:</span> Look underneath for loose or broken exhaust clamps and supports. Check for holes in muffler or pipes. Replace rusted or damaged parts. Have emission damaged parts replaced. Have emission checked at least once per year for compliance with local laws. </li>

<li><span>Hoses:</span> Inspect belts and hoses monthly. Replace worn, glazed or frayed belts. Tighten them when more than 1/2" of slack can be depressed between the pulleys. Vehicles with spring loaded belt tensioners require no adjustment. Replace bulging, rotten or brittle hoses and tighten clamps. If a hose looks bad, or feels too soft or too hard, it should be replaced. </li>

<li><span>Lights:</span> Be sure all your lights are clean and working, including brake lights, turn signals and emergency flashers. Always keep spare bulbs and fuses in your vehicle. </li>

<li><span>Oil Filter:</span> Replace oil filter with every oil change. </li>

<li><span>Power Steering Fluid:</span> You should check the power steering fluid level once a month. Just remove the reservoir dipstick. If the level is low, add fluid and inspect the pump and hoses for leaks. 

<li><span>Shock Absorbers:</span> Look for signs of oil seepage on shock absorbers. Test the shock action by bouncing the car up and down. The car should stop bouncing when you step back. Worn or leaking shocks should be replaced. Always replace shock absorbers in pairs. </li>

<li><span>Tires:</span> Keep tires inflated to recommended pressure (it helps to own your own gauge). Check for cuts, bulges and excessive tread wear. Uneven wear indicates tires are misaligned or out of balance. Keep a record of tire rotation. Rotate at the first 5,000 miles and every 7,500 miles thereafter. </li>

<li><span>Transmission Fluid:</span> Check transmission fluid monthly with engine warm and running, and parking brake on. Shift to drive, then to park. Remove dipstick, wipe dry, insert it and remove it again. Add the approved type fluid, if needed. Caution: Do Not Overfill! </li>

<li><span>Washer Fluid:</span> Keep windshield washer fluid reservoir full. When topping off, use some windshield washer fluid on a rag to clean off the wiper blades. In the winter months, pay attention to the freezing point of the washer fluid. </li>

<li><span>Wiper Blades:</span> In the winter months, pay attention to the freezing point of the washer fluid. Wiper Blades: Inspect windshield wiper blades whenever you clean your windshield. Do not wait until rubber is worn or brittle to replace them. Wiper blades should be replaced at least once per year, and more often if smearing or chattering occurs.</li>
